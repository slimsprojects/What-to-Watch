# What-to-Watch
What to Watch/ Movie Desire app

This is the first app I created. It is built with python and tkinter for the gui. 
Users can store movies, a watch desire rank, and a watched movie rank to a database 
There are buttons for different ways to view your data
- highest to lowest desire
- highest to lowest rank
- by desire
- by rank
- whole list

I have added some user error handling but still need to add more. This is currently a working V1.0.
