# What-to-Watch
The What to Watch app: add movies to watch to a database with a desire score then rank it after

Install Instructions:\
set up pyenv and set python version version to python 3.8.1\
install pipenv\
run: pipenv run python database.py


This is an app I created using python for the main code, SQL for querying the database, and tkinter framework for the gui\
Users can store movies in a database with a watch desire rank and a watched movie rank to be added later\
Users can also see IMDB ratings \
User can query the data for highest to lowest desire, highest to lowest rank, by desire, or by rank\
There are buttons for each different ways to view your data

I have added some user error handling but still need to add more. This is currently a working V1.0.
